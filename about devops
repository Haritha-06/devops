*At its core, DevOps is a philosophy and practice focused on agility, collaboration, and automation within IT and development team processes.
*Traditionally, software development occurred in silos, with IT and development working independently within their own teams and processes. 
*This separation and competing values created an environment rife with miscommunication, poor alignment, 
and production delays (some have even nicknamed the operations department the “War Room”).
*DevOps is the response to the “us vs. them” culture of development.
*The goal is to bridge the gap between IT operations and development to improve communication and collaboration, 
create more seamless processes, and align strategy and objectives for faster and more efficient delivery.
